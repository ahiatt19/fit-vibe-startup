Fitness Website for CS260

Structure
  HTML - Basic structural and organizational elements
  
  CSS - Styling and animating
  
  JavaScript - Interactivity (e.g. What happens when a user presses a button)
  
  Web service - Remote functions that your application calls on your, or someone else's, web server (e.g. saveScores, getWeather, chatWithFriend)
  
  Authentication - Creating accounts and logging in
  
  Database persistence - Storing user data in a database (e.g. Save the high scores and login information)
  
  WebSocket - Support for pushing data from the server. This can be peer to peer communication (e.g. chatting with friends through the browser), or realtime data from the server (e.g. stock prices or the                   current game leader).
  Web framework - Using React to add components and request routing
